## Task 01: Population Data Visualization

## 📌 Task Description
The objective of this task is to create a **bar chart or histogram** to visualize the distribution of a **categorical or continuous variable** (such as age or gender) in a population dataset.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Name: Heart Disease Dataset  
- File Used: `raw_merged_heart_dataset.csv`  
- Source: Publicly available dataset  
- Key Features Used:
  - `age` (continuous variable)
  - `sex` (categorical variable)

---

## 📈 Visualizations Performed

### 1️⃣ Age Distribution (Histogram)
- A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of ages in the dataset.
- This helps in understanding how age values are spread across the population.

### 2️⃣ Sex Distribution (Bar Chart)
- A bar chart was used to visualize the distribution of sex in the dataset.
- Encoded values were mapped to meaningful categories (Male / Female) for better interpretability.
